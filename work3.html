          <h2>User research summary</h2>
          <p>
            I conducted interviews and created empathy maps to understand the
            users I’m designing for and their needs. A primary user group
            identified through research was retired people of age over 65 years
            old who has a lot of free time and frequent art school 2-3 times a
            week. The secondary user group is young lonely people who study or
            work and don’t have too much time to search shedule and who likes to
            visit art lessons in their free time.
          </p>
          <p>
            The user group confirmed initial assumption about art school
            students and also revealed that some part of users is not familiar
            with technology, have problems with choosing available lessons.
          </p>
          <h3>User pain points:</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <b>Technology:</b> Some users are unfamiliar with technology , as
              like as old people or children
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Time:</b> Working people don’t have much time to navigate and
              choose lessons
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Place map:</b> People who moved in their place in recent time
              have dificulty with understand where and how to reach the school
            </li>
            <li>
              <b>Accessibility:</b> Old people, children, foreiners and people
              with dislexia have difficulty to understand long text pieces
            </li>
