        <h2>User research summary</h2>
        <p>
          I conducted interviews and created empathy maps to understand the
          users I’m designing for and their needs. A primary user group
          identified through research was people of age over 18 years old who
          have new born babies, especially first-time parents, this user group
          is overwhelmed with different duties that have to commit with little
          children and have little time to browse in internet.
        </p>
        <p>
          The secondary user group are people who have adult children first time
          parents. The user group confirmed initial assumption about first time
          parents and also revealed that some part of users is not familiar with
          technology, have problems with choosing available goods.

        <h2>Ideation</h2>
        <p>
          I did quick first ideation process to come up with ideas for how to
          adress gaps identified in the competitive audit. My focus was in
          simplicity searching and ordering goods

        <h2>Digital wireframes</h2>
        <p>
          After ideating and paper wireframe process I created the initial
          designs for the app for first time parents. The design focused on easy
          access to different parts of the app

        <h2>Low fidelity prototype</h2>
        <p>
          To prepare for usability study I created a

        <h2>Usability study</h2>
        <p>Parameters:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Study type: unmoderated usability study</li>
          <li>Participants: 7</li>
          <li>Location: USA, remotes</li>
          <li>Length: 30-60 minutes</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The main findings uncovered by usability study:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>People want easy searching themes of interest.</li>
          <li>
            People had difficulty choosing and adding to cart desirable good.
          </li>
          <li>People need indication how to complete o modificate order.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>
      <section>

        <h2>Mockups</h2>
        <p>
          Based on the insights from the usability study, I applied design
          changes like providing a clear section of searching desirable themes
          in searching input
