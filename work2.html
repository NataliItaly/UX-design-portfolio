            <h1>Design movie theatre app</h1>
            <h2>Project Background</h2>
            <p>
              I created a Movie Theatre app to attract and retain customers in
              cinemas and theatres. We noticed that our competitors offer
              dedicated mobile apps for their customers to order through, and
              they have been very successful. We want to create a product that
              can compete in the market, improve sales, and increase customer
              satisfaction.
            </p>
            <h3>My role</h3>
            <p>
              UX designer leading the app design from conception to delivery.
            </p>
            <h3>Responsibilities</h3>
            <p>
              Conducting interviews, paper and digital wireframing, low and high
              fidelity prototyping, conducting usability studies, accounting for
              accessibility, iterating on designs, determining information
              architechture and responsive design.

          <h3>The problem:</h3>
          <p>
            People above 65 years old, busy workers, families with children can
            easy access and book movie tickets
          </p>
          <h3>The goal:</h3>
          <p>
            Design an app that allows people easily access, search and book
            movie tickets choosing by date, time, location and cinema’s sits

          <h2>Understanding the user</h2>
          <p>
            I conducted interviews and created empathy maps to understand the
            users I’m designing for and their needs. A primary user group
            identified through research was retired people of age over 65 years
            old who has a lot of free time and enjoy movie theatre 2-3 times a
            weeek. The secondary user group is young lonely people who study or
            work and don’t have too much time to search shedule and who likes to
            see movies alone or with their friends.
          </p>
          <p>
            The user group confirmed initial assumption about theatre movies
            users and also revealed that some part of users is not familiar with
            technology, have problems with reaching to the movie theatres
            places.
          </p>
          <p>user research pain points:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <h3>Technology</h3>
              <p>
                Some users are unfamiliar with technology , as like as old
                people or children
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h3>Time</h3>
              <p>
                Working people don’t have much time to navigate and choose
                movies
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h3>Place map</h3>
              <p>
                People who moved in their place in recent time have dificulty
                with understand where and how to reach to movie theatre
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <h3>Accessibility</h3>
              <p>
                Old people, children, foreiners and people with dislexia have
                difficulty to understand long text pieces

          <h2>Usability study results</h2>
          <p>
            I conducted two rounds of usability studies. Findings from the first
            study helped guide the designs from wireframes to mockups. The
            second study used a high-fidelity prototype and revealed what
            aspects of the mockups needed refining.

            <h3>Round 1 findings</h3>

            <h3>Round 2 findings</h3>

          <h2>Takeaways</h2>
          <h3>Impact</h3>
          <p>
            The app makes users feel like movie theatre app really thinks about
            how to meet their needs.  One quote from peer feedback: ‘I like to
            use the app, I find different options to search movies and booking
            process is comfortable and quick
          </p>
          <h3>What I learned</h3>
          <p>
            While designing the Movie theatre app, I learned that the first
            ideas for the app are only the beginning of the process. Usability
            studies and peer feedback influenced each iteration of the app’s
            designs.
          </p>

          <h2>Next steps</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Conduct another round of usability studies to validate whether the
              pain points users experienced have been effectively addressed.
            </li>
            <li>
              Conduct more user research to determine any new areas of need.
            </li>
            <li>Conduct competitive audit to find new feature</li>
